# Vandy-Project-01

## Description

The Local List repository leverages multiple API's to first get coordinates for the input origin and destination city, then will display flight prices from selected dates, and finally lists local events. The API data displays dynamically once the search button is hit. 

The goal of this project is to:

- Create a dynamic webpage displaying data from Ticketmaster, Open weather map and SkyScanner API.
- Use a weather API to find coordinates from the inputted city
- Display origin and destination cities from local storage to the webpage
- Using Tailwind, style webpage for visual aesthetics and read ability
- Collaborate with team, merging multiple branches to create a final product


The motivation behind the project is to create a dynamic webpage where users can pick an origin and destination city from a specified date range to find flight prices and a list of local events.
